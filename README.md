## About Me

### Education

I am currently a student at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/), majoring in **Electrical Engineering**.

### Research Interests

My primary interests are in machine learning, privacy in machine learning, trustworthy AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs). I am also passionate about computer vision and image processing.

### Working Experience

I am currently working at **MCILab** as part of the **LLM team**, where we are training a large language model (LLM) for the Persian language. One of our major challenges is data collection, as available data in Persian is quite limited. We are also working on the evaluation of the LLM and aligning it to ensure it does not respond to certain types of questions.
